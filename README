Tic Tac Toe - A dark themed Tic Tac Toe game.
Copyright (C) 2015 Zachariah Levine

Game currently implements a GUI; the text-based game is still present as a callable function.

Currently, the one player mode is just an AI that makes random moves.

SDL2 is required to compile and run this program, and can be installed with
your package manager or compiled from source from https://www.libsdl.org/.

To compile, execute "make" in src.
This should produce the executable ./tictactoe
